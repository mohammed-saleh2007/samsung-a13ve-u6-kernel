this file is more tham 200MB and github hates files more than 100MB then I spkitted it into 3 files with command
```
split -b 50MB SM-A137F_EUR_14_Opensource.zip samsung-opensource-zip_
rm SM-A137F_EUR_14_Opensource.zip 
```

to return it back again
```
cat samsung-opensource-zip_a* > SM-A137F_EUR_14_Opensource.zip
``` 

to check if file have no carruptions
```
md5sum SM-A137F_EUR_14_Opensource.zip
```

if the output was
```
